Flexibility: Agile teams are self-organizing and adjust their approach as needed to meet requirements.
Collaboration: Ongoing collaboration with stakeholders and users is crucial.
Value Delivery: The goal is to deliver value quickly and frequently.

waterfall;Sequential and Rigid: Waterfall follows a linear process with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, development, testing) completed in order.
Thorough Planning: Detailed planning occurs upfront, and each stage must be fully completed before moving to the next.
Less Flexibility: Changes are challenging once a phase begins.
Predictability: Waterfall provides a clear roadmap and timeline.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It involves gathering, analyzing, documenting, and managing system requirements to ensure that software meets user needs and expectations
Elicitation: Interact with stakeholders (users, clients, domain experts) to understand their needs, desires, and constraints.
Analysis: Evaluate requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness. Identify conflicts and prioritize features.
Specification: Document requirements in a clear, unambiguous manner using natural language, diagrams, or formal notations.
Validation: Verify that requirements align with stakeholders’ expectations and are achievable.
Management: Maintain and track changes to requirements throughout the project.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design refers to a logical partitioning of the software into smaller, independent modules. These modules can be functions, classes, or components.
Here’s how modularity benefits software systems 
Reduced Complexity:
By breaking down complex software into smaller, cohesive modules, modularity simplifies understanding and management.
Each module focuses on a specific function or feature, making it easier to reason about and maintain.
Improved Maintainability:
When changes are needed, you can modify individual modules without affecting the entire system.
Isolating changes minimizes the risk of unintended side effects.
Maintenance becomes more efficient and cost-effective.
Enhanced Scalability:
Adding new features or scaling up the system involves extending existing modules or introducing new ones.
Modularity allows seamless integration of these additions without disrupting the overall architecture.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit Testing:
Purpose: Tests individual components (e.g., methods, functions) in isolation.
Focus: Verifies functionality at the code level.
Benefits: Identifies defects early, improves code quality, and supports refactoring.
Example: Testing a calculator program’s addition function.
Integration Testing:
Purpose: Validates interactions between components/modules.
Focus: Ensures seamless data flow across interconnected parts.
Benefits: Detects integration issues and ensures component collaboration.
Example: Checking if login and database modules work together.
System Testing:
Purpose: Evaluates the entire system against functional and non-functional requirements.
Focus: End-to-end testing of the software.
Benefits: Validates overall behavior and performance.
Example: Testing a web application’s user interface, security, and scalability.
Acceptance Testing:
Purpose: Validates software against stakeholder criteria.
Focus: Ensures alignment with specified requirements.
Benefits: Confirms readiness for deployment.
Example: User acceptance testing (UAT) by end-users.
Why Testing Matters:
Quality Assurance: Testing ensures software meets expectations and functions correctly.
Bug Prevention: Identifies defects early, reducing costly rework.
Risk Mitigation: Minimizes project risks and enhances reliability.
Customer Satisfaction: High-quality software leads to satisfied users.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems (VCS) play a crucial role in software development by managing changes to codebases. They ensure that modifications to source code are trackable and reversible. Here’s why they matter:
Streamlined Release Management:
VCS helps maintain different software versions aligned with release roadmaps.
Each release encapsulates enhancements and features for specific customers.
Conflict Prevention:
Separate branches for different releases minimize code conflicts.
Changes don’t overlap, reducing the risk of conflicts.
Tracking Changes to Digital Artifacts:
Beyond code, VCS tracks changes to other artifacts (e.g., design specs, requirements).
Ensures consistency across iterations.
Popular VCS Examples:
Git: Widely used, fast, flexible, and robust.
Subversion (SVN): Centralized, suitable for large projects.
Mercurial: Distributed, user-friendly.
